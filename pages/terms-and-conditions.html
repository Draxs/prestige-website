    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">Rental Agreement between Owner and Customer</h4>
    <p class="text-justify font-md">The following Terms and Conditions together with the general information contained on our website(s) form the basis of your contract with the Owners of the property. The address and contact details of the owners are held on file by the Prestige Bookings, and in most cases these are released to you before your arrival at our property. These details can also be released to you on request. Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully as they set out our respective rights and obligations. In this document, you, your(s), “Customer(s)” means all persons named on the booking form (including anyone who is added or substituted at a later date). We, us, ours, “Owner(s)” refers to the Owners of the property. Booking Agent(s) means Prestige Bookings.com “Booking Conditions”, “Terms and Conditions”, “Rental Agreement”, “Agreement” refers to this document. All bookings are made subject to these booking conditions.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">1. Making your booking</h4>
    <p class="text-justify font-md">Bookings can be made online, or by emailing Prestige Bookings, or by contacting Prestige Bookings direct by telephone or other means, or through our agents. Once we have received your booking and booking deposit, we will, subject to availability, confirm your stay by issuing a confirmation invoice by email. This invoice will be sent to the party leader. Please check this invoice carefully as soon as you receive it. Contact us immediately if any information which appears on the confirmation or any other document appears to be incorrect or incomplete as it may not be possible to make changes later. We regret we cannot accept any liability if we or our Booking Agents are not notified of any inaccuracies in any document within 5 working days of our sending it out.</p>
    <p>Number of persons</p>
    <p>Only those persons whose name appears on the Booking Form may use the property. The number of persons (adults and children) must not exceed the number of sleeping places indicated on the website. The substitution of persons during the rental period is forbidden unless previously agreed.</p>
    <p>Arrivals</p>
    <p>On arrival you must be prepared to present your confirmation details as well as your passport or identity card to us or to our representatives.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">2. Payment</h4>
    <p>In order to confirm your stay, a deposit of 30% of the full payment (or full payment if booking within 70 days of departure) must be paid at the time of booking. Payment can be made by credit card. Bookings are only confirmed once the payment has been received by us. This deposit is not refundable in the event of your cancellation or failure to pay on time as set out below. The balance of the cost of your stay must be received by us not less than 70 days prior to arrival (or at the time of booking if this date has passed). This date will be shown on the confirmation invoice. If you have not paid in full and on time we reserve the right to treat your booking as cancelled by you. In this case the cancellation charges set out in clause 6 below will be payable.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">2a. Accidental damage</h4>
    <p>Security Deposit</p>
    <p>All of our villas have a Refundable Security Deposit of €300 to €1000, which is used to protect villa owners or local suppliers against any breakages, loss, damage, unpaid local charges, additional housekeeping and any other charges. Where applicable, the cost of the security deposit will be included on your confirmation invoice and payable with your holiday balance. This amount will be refunded to you within 4 weeks of your return date (by same means as paid),less any damage, losses, unpaid bills etc. In the event of substantial damage/abuse to a villa, you will have to leave and find alternative accommodation at your own cost. Should the security deposit prove inadequate to fully cover any costs that arise, then we reserve the right to invoice you (either directly or through our agents) for immediate payment.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">3. Your contract</h4>
    <p>A binding contract between us comes into existence when the deposit payment is paid (see clause 2 above). If you cancel after paying the deposit our normal cancellation charges will apply. This contract and all matters arising out of it are governed by Cyprus law. We both agree that any dispute arising out of or connected with your holiday will be dealt with by the Courts of Cyprus.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">4. The cost of your stay</h4>
    <p>We reserve the right to increase or decrease the prices of accommodation at any time. The price of your stay will be confirmed at the time of booking, subject to the correction of errors. We reserve the right to correct errors in both advertised and confirmed prices. We will do so as soon as we become aware of the error. Please note, changes and errors occasionally occur. You must check the price of your stay at the time of booking.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">5. Changes by you</h4>
    <p>Should you wish to make any changes to your confirmed booking, you must notify us by email as soon as possible. Whilst we will endeavor to assist, we cannot guarantee we will be able to meet any such requests. Where we can, an amendment fee may be payable together with any costs incurred by ourselves.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">6. Cancellation by you</h4>
    <p>Should you need to cancel your stay after the contract has begun (see clause 3 above), the party leader must immediately advise our Booking Agents either by advising them in writing (including by email). Your notice of cancellation will only be effective when it is received in writing by Prestige Bookings. As we incur costs from the time your booking is confirmed and may be unable to re-sell your period of stay, the following cancellation charges will be payable. Where the cancellation charge is shown as a percentage, this is calculated on the basis of the total cost of the booking excluding amendment charges. Amendment charges are not refundable in the event of cancellation.</p>
    <p>Period before start of stay within which written/email notification of cancellation is received by us:</p>
    <p>Cancellation more than 70 days - deposit only</p>
    <p>69 – 56 days before arrival 50% of holiday cost</p>
    <p>55 days or less before arrival - 100% of holiday cost</p>
    <p>Depending on the reason for cancellation, you may be able to reclaim these cancellation charges (less any applicable excess) under the terms of any insurance policy you may have. Claims must be made directly to the insurance company concerned.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">7. Insurance</h4>
    <p>It is part of this contract that you take out adequate travel insurance. Please read your policy details carefully. It is your responsibility to ensure that the insurance cover you purchase is adequate for your particular needs.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">8. Changes and cancellation by us</h4>
    <p>Occasionally, we have to make changes to and correct errors on our website descriptions and other details both before and after bookings have been confirmed and cancel confirmed bookings. Whilst we always endeavor to avoid changes and cancellations, we must reserve the right to do so. If we have to make a significant change to or cancel you’re booking, we will tell you as soon as possible. We will endeavor to offer you an alternative should a significant change or cancellation occur. We regret we cannot pay any expenses, costs or losses incurred by you as a result of any change or cancellation. Very rarely, we may be forced by “force majeure” (see clause 9) to change or terminate your stay after departure but before the scheduled end of your time away. This is extremely unlikely but if this situation does occur, we regret we will be unable to make any refunds, pay you any compensation or meet any costs or expenses you incur as a result.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">9. Force Majeure</h4>
    <p>We regret we cannot accept liability or pay any compensation where the performance or prompt performance of our contractual obligations is prevented, or affected by, or you otherwise suffer any damage or loss as a result of “force majeure”. In these Booking Conditions, “force majeure” means any event which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due care, foresee or avoid. Such events may include war or threat of war, riot, civil strife, actual or threatened terrorist activity, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, adverse weather conditions, fire and all similar events outside our control.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">10. Our Liability to you</h4>
    <p>10.1. We promise to provide your accommodation with reasonable skill and care. We do not accept responsibility if any death, personal injury, failure or deficiency of your accommodation arrangements is not caused by any fault of ours. When we talk about fault above, this means failure by ourselves to use reasonable skill and care in performing or providing the service in question. Please note it is your responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish to make a claim. We will not be responsible for any injury, illness, death, loss (for example loss of enjoyment), damage, expense, cost or other sum or claim of any description whatsoever which results from any of the following:</p>
    <p>(a) the fault of the person(s) affected or any member(s) of their party or</p>
    <p>(b) the fault of a third party not connected with the provision of your accommodation by us which we could not have predicted or avoided or</p>
    <p>(c) an event or circumstance which could not have predicted or avoided even after taking all reasonable care (see clause 9)</p>
    <p>In addition, we will not be responsible where you do not enjoy your stay or suffer any problems because of a reason you did not tell us about when you booked your stay, or where any problems you suffer did not result from any breach of our contract, or other fault of ourselves or any losses, expenses, costs or other sum you have suffered related to any business. Please note, we cannot accept responsibility for any services that do not form part of our contract. This includes, for example, any additional services or facilities; any other supplier agrees to provide for you.</p>
    <p>10.2. The promises we make to you about the accommodation we have agreed to provide or arrange as part of our contract – and the laws and regulations of the country in which your claim or complaint occurred – will be used as the basis for deciding whether the accommodation in question had been properly provided. If the particular accommodation which gave rise to the claim or complaint complied with local laws and regulations applicable to those accommodation at the time, the accommodation will be treated as having been properly provided. This will be the case even if the accommodation did not comply with the laws and regulations of the UK (or your country of origin) which would have applied had that accommodation been provided in the UK (or your country of origin).</p>
    <p>10.3. *We limit the maximum amount we may have to pay you for any and all claims or parts of claims which do not involve personal injury, illness or death. Except where loss of and/or damage to luggage or personal possessions is concerned or a lower limitation of liability applies to your claim, the maximum amount we will have to pay you for such non personal injury claims if we are found liable to you on any basis is twice the price (excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges) paid by or on behalf of the person(s) affected in total. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you have not received any benefit at all from your stay.</p>
    <p>*We are not liable for loss of and/or damage to any luggage or personal possessions (including money) whatsoever.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">11. Complaints and problems</h4>
    <p>In the unlikely event that you have any reason to complain or experience any problems with your stay whilst away, you must immediately inform us. Any verbal notification must be put in writing and given to us within 48 hours. Until we know about a problem or complaint, we cannot begin to resolve it. Most problems can be dealt with quickly. For all complaints and claims which do not involve death, personal injury or illness, we regret we cannot accept liability if you fail to notify the complaint or claim entirely in accordance with this clause.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">12. Behavior</h4>
    <p>You accept responsibility for any damage or loss caused by you or any member of your party. Full payment for any such damage or loss must be paid direct to the owner at the time. If you fail to do so, you will be responsible for meeting any legal costs we incur in full, in recovering full payment from you.</p>
    <p>We expect all clients to have consideration for other people. If in our reasonable opinion or in the reasonable opinion of any other person in authority, you or any member of your party behaves in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause danger, upset or distress to any third party or damage to the property, or in any way damage the reputation and/or goodwill of the Owner, we are entitled, without prior notice, to terminate the occupation of the person(s) concerned. In this situation, the person(s) concerned will be required to leave the accommodation. We will have no further responsibility toward such person(s). No refunds will be made and we will not pay any expenses or costs incurred as a result of the termination.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">13. Special requests and medical problems</h4>
    <p>If you have any special request, you must advise us at the time of booking and clearly note it in the extra information section of the booking form. *Although we will endeavor to meet any reasonable requests we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met. Failure to meet any special request will not be a breach of contract on our part. We regret we cannot accept any conditional bookings, i.e. any booking which is specified to be conditional on the fulfillment of a particular request. All such bookings will be treated as standard bookings subject to the above provisions on special requests. If you or any member of your party has any medical problem or disability that may affect your stay, please tell us before you confirm your booking so that we can advise as to the suitability of the chosen arrangements. In any event, you must give us full details in writing at the time of booking. If we reasonably feel unable to properly accommodate the particular needs of the person concerned, we must reserve the right to decline their reservation or, if full details are not given at the time of booking, cancel when we become aware of these details.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">14. Passports, visas and health requirements</h4>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in possession of all necessary travel and health documents (including Passports and Visas (where applicable) before departure. You must pay all costs incurred in obtaining such documentation. You must check passport and visa requirements with the Embassy or Consulate of the country(i.e.) to or through which you are intending to travel.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">15. Prices and Website Accuracy</h4>
    <p>Please note, the information and prices shown on our website may have changed by the time you come to book your stay. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the website and prices at the time of requesting the booking, regrettably errors do occasionally occur. You must therefore ensure you check all details of your stay (including the price) on your booking acceptance.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">16. Responsibilities and the role of Prestige Bookings</h4>
    <p>Prestige Bookings is not the principal of this contract. Prestige Bookings have visited and checked this property. The description appearing on the website has been provided by the accommodation Owners and has been prepared in good faith. Prestige Bookings therefore, declines all responsibility for any inaccuracy, as it is beyond its control. Prestige Bookings provides and is responsible for the booking and payment and payment facilities.</p>
    <h4 class="ft-500 uk-text-left">17. Complaints procedure</h4>
    <p>In the event of any problems you must contact us immediately, plus you undertake to do your best to resolve, or minimize the problem in order to avoid any prejudices that could result. You must immediately get in touch with us by telephone on the day of your arrival, confirming your complaint in writing within 24 hours by fax or by e-mail. You are obliged to give us the time necessary to resolve the problem.</p>
    <p>Should there be no written complaint supplied as above specified and you leave the accommodation prematurely and without an explicit authorization by us, you forfeit your rights for a refund of the rental price, unless the terms of this contract have been breached. Complaints received at the end of the stay will not be taken into consideration and no refunds will be given. Should a complaint be upheld and a refund forthcoming but the amount of refund cannot be agreed between you and the owner, Prestige Bookings will act as an independent arbitrator and decide on the amount of refund if any that is due.</p>
    <p>Please note that the property is not an official tourist structure, such as a hotel, residences, etc. but a private dwelling. Being such, there is no standard or categories that are internationally recognized; indeed it reflects the architecture and furnishings, the local traditions and the personal taste of the Owner. This is precisely the kind of holiday that we offer: the chance to partake in the culture of the area chosen, living for a few weeks in the same surroundings as an inhabitant would. We cannot however exclude the possibility that these differences can sometimes result in minor inconveniences – due to the special nature of its architecture and of traditions in the area – but which cannot be accepted as complaints.</p>
